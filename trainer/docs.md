# Emotion Extraction Model

## Supervised Learning Approach

The Emotion Extraction Model uses a **Supervised Learning** method for both **Multiclass** and **Binary** classification tasks.

## Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained LLMs

For optimal results, this model is designed to fine-tune the following pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs):

- **RoBERTa**
- **DistilBERT**
- **BERT**
- **ModernBERT**

---

## Notes

- The model has **not been tested** on other LLMs yet.
- Ensure that the chosen pre-trained model aligns with the specific requirements of your classification task.
